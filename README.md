# What is "Annoying snake" ? 
Annoying snake is a sub-project for the "Ludis"(Newton's pendulum) project , made in flutter.

The purpose of this sub-project is to demonstrate the usage of the Draggable widget.

## Main Idea

Shockingly for some people , Snakes like eating eggs. In our project , you can drag the egg all-over the screen , while the annoying Python snake tries to reach the egg and eats it. 
if the snake reaches the egg , the player loses. the more time you drag the egg all over the screen , the higher your score will be.
